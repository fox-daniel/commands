To speed up Python code, try the following, in order:

1. use numpy and vectorize (in python)
2. switch to PyPy (uses JIT (just in time compilation))
	-works best for long run time programs so that the overhead of the PyPy compiler doesn't over shadow
	- has not worked for me with numpy
3. switch to Numba: this speeds up loops and numpy code; it does not compatible with all packages; does not work well with lambdas and other Python features
4. Cython: you are changing your code; this is more extreme; your code may not run in Python any more
5. Rewrite code in Rust or C


To check Python implementation:
$ ipython
[]: import platform
[]: platform.python_implementation():

PyPy: Install in a venv or conda env; use brew install within the env

	Conda env:

	- make a conda env with python=3.6 (=3.8 caused the pypy env to crash)
	- activate conda env
	- $ conda install -c conda-forge pypy3.6
	- check that pypy3 is working:
		$ pypy3
		(should open pypy environment)
	- $ conda install <packages such as numpy>

	- https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/install.html
	- Install: 
		$ brew install pypy3

		Use: easy_install_pypy3 and pip_pypy3

		To update pip and setuptools between pypy3 releases, run:
	    $ pip_pypy3 install --upgrade pip setuptools

	- To install packages for use with PyPy, use a pypy venv 
		(or: $ pypy3 -mpip install <package>)


	When brew installed pypy, received:

	Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
	The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
	Could not symlink bin/2to3
	Target /usr/local/bin/2to3
	already exists. You may want to remove it:
	  rm '/usr/local/bin/2to3'

	To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
	  brew link --overwrite python@3.8

	To list all files that would be deleted:
	  brew link --overwrite --dry-run python@3.8
