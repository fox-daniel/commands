NOTE: "master" has been replaced by "main"; use "master" instead of "main" for older repos

Clone:

	$ git clone <url> <new_name>

Create a local repo. From within the directory:
	$ git init

To remove a repo (not the files, but the repo structure from git):
	$ rm -rf .git

To remove the repo and the directory itself:
	$ rm -rf <dir>

REMOTES:

	Show remotes:

	$ git remote -v

	Add a remote:

	$ git remote add <short name> <url>

	Remove a remote:

	$ git remote remove <short name>

	To look at a remote added by someone else:

	$ git fetch origin <branch_name>
	$ git checkout <branch_name>

	To update a remote branch of which you have an old copy locally:

	$ git checkout <branch_name>
	$ git merge origin/<branch_name>

	If a deleted remote is still tracked (appears with $git branch -a)

	$git remote prune origin

	Or remove a particular remote branch:

	$git branch -d -r origin/<branch>

	Retrieve a single file from a git repo without cloning. The url 
	should be for the raw file (click "raw" button in GitHub)

	$ wget <url>

	Compare local branch to remote branch. This does not activate a merge. 
	From within local branch:

	$ git fetch origin branch_name
	$ git diff FETCH_HEAD 

	If remote branch is not pulling properly, e.g. some file appears as deleted locally even after pull:
	$ git reset --hard origin/main

Three Trees:
	HEAD: this normally sits at and points to the last commit
	INDEX: these are the staged files
	WORKING DIRECTORY: sandbox, files may be unstaged

Show history:
	$ git hist

Show history in more detail:
	$ git reflog

Checkout older commit:

	$ git checkout <ref>

Return to up to date state:

	$ git checkout main

Show Commits

	$ git show <ref>
		<ref> is a hash, abbreviated hash, HEAD~k, HEAD^n
		HEAD~k gives kth parent
		HEAD^n gives nth parent of a merge 
		commit info and diffs are shown

	To show an old version of a file and pipe to a file to save and peruse:
	$ git show <commit hash>:path/to/file > old_version_file
		 

Adding Parts of a file:

	If the file is not yet in the repository:
	$ git add -N <filename>

	Then:
	$ git add --patch <filename>
		-> Interactive session opened in which you can select parts to add to the staging area


Show tracked files:

	$ git ls-tree -r main --name-only

Branching

	create a branch:
	$ git branch <name>

	To move/rename a branch:
	$ git branch -m [<old name>] <new name>

	switch branches
	$ git checkout <name>

	graph branches
	$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph

	$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --allows

	create and switch to new branch
	$ git checkout -b <name>

	show branches
	$ git branch

	compare branch1 and branch2
	$ git checkout branch1
	$ git diff branch1..branch2

	show branches and last commits
	$ git branch -v

	See last 10 branches visited:
	$ git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --count=10

	Rename a branch: 
	$ git checkout <branch to rename>
	$ git branch -m <new name>
	or
	$ git branch -m <oldname> <newname>

	Delete a branch

	$ git branch -d <name>
	$ git branch -D <name> // if not fully merged

	
Merge

	1. move to main branch
		$ git checkout main
	2. merge
		$ git merge <name of branch>
	3. delete branch that has been merged
		$ git branch -d <name>

	4. finalize merge with a commit
		$ git commit -am "message"
	To merge changes in main to another branch
	1. $ git checkout <branch name>
	2. $ git merge main

	See $ git mergetool

	Merge Conflicts
		$git merge --abort

		Resolve conflicts by checking which files conflict:
			$ git status
			Open and edit the files (handle all: <<<<<....=====.....>>>>> ).
			Commit. 
			Merge/Push.

Rebase

	State: create a new history in which work that was done in parallel now appears in sequence

	To rebase branch_1 onto branch_2:
	$ git checkout branch_1
	$ git rebase branch_2
	$ git checkout branch_2
	$ git merge branch_1

	The above causes commits from branch_1 to appear as part of branch_2, tacked onto the end.

	-----OR-----

	To rebase branch_1 onto branch_2 in order to make a PR to merge branch_1 into (remote) branch_2 (e.g. branch_2 = origin main)

	$ git pull origin branch_2 //make sure it is up to date
	$ git checkout branch_1
	$ git rebase -i branch_2
		If conflicts, check which files have conflicts:
			$ git status
			Open the files in an editor and resolve conflicts by hand (handle all: <<<<<....=====.....>>>>> )
			$ git add <conflicting files that were resolved>
			$ git commit <message etc>
			$ git rebase --continue
	$ git push -f origin branch_1
	$ make a PR 

Stop Tracking a File:

	$ git rm --cache <file>

	Then commit; add file to .gitignore if don't want it tracked in the future

List ignored files:

	git ls-files . --ignored --exclude-standard --others

List untracked files:

	git ls-files . --exclude-standard --others

Retrieve version of file from a different branch and write it to <new_file>:

	git show <branch>:<path to file> > <new_file>

Retrieve old version of a file from "n" commits ago (path is relative to repo):

	git show HEAD~<n>:<path to file>


Stashing: save work not ready for a commit before switching branches
	
	stash the current state of the current branch:
	$ git stash

	see what you have stored in the stack:
	$ git stash list

	apply a stash
	$ git stash apply 

	apply not the most recent stash:
	$ git stash apply stash@{2}

	see the diff of stashed files (in stash@{i} for some i) from parent:
	$ git stash show -p stash@{i}



RESET: soft, mixed, hard
	$ git reset --soft <ref>
		makes HEAD point to <ref>
		does not change INDEX
		does not change WORKING DIRECTORY
		it essentially undoes last commit; does not undo last git add or alter working dir
		if git add and git commit are used it is equivalent to git commit --amend

	$ git reset --mixed <ref>
		equivalent to $ git reset <ref>
		moves HEAD to <ref>
		updates INDEX  with contents of <ref>
		undid git commit
		undid git add

	$ git reset --hard <ref>
		moves HEAD to <ref>
		updates INDEX  with contents of <ref>
		removes all work in WORKING DIRECTORY
		DESTROYS data!

	$ git reset -- <ref> file.txt
		copies version of file.txt at <ref> to INDEX
		does not change working dir
		essentially unstages file.txt
		allows revert to old version of file without putting that in the working directory

	Unstage a single file:

		$ git reset HEAD -- <file>

REFLOG
	Git has blobs of file states and metadata (commits, pointers to commits, etc)
	To see the history that includes all changes to commits and pointers:
	$ git reflog 

Show DIFFs
	
	show diffs between current working dir and commit referenced
	$ git diff --color <ref>

	show diffs between stagin area and commit referenced
	$ git diff --color --staged <ref>

Squash: combine multiple commits into one
	$ git reset --soft <ref>
	$ git commit

Bisect: use test scripts that return 0 for good and 1 for bad and 125 for can't run to automate finding the first commit with a change in code

	To automate, the test script needs to be present for all commits being tested! So need to set this up at the beginning.

	Help:
	$ git bisect --help

	To start a session:
	$git bisect start

	Mark the current as bad:
	$ git bisect bad <commit or leave blank for current>

	Mark an earlier as good:
	$ git bisect good <commit>

	$ git bisect run test_script


	Finish session and return to original head:
	$ git bisect reset

Display the number of lines of code:
	$ git ls-files | xargs wc -l

	For just .py files:
	$ git ls-files | grep '\.py' | xargs wc -l

To Land a Pull Request (PR) from branch_1:

	1. create a new branch -- this could be a backup branch (branch_1_backup) 
	2. git reset --soft <ref> // where <ref> is the last commit that good changes can be put on
	3. git add...   |
					| -> repeat add/commit file by file, or even pieces of files
	4. git commit...| 

	Note, PRs can be to branches other than main.

Commit Message -- Editor Set Up
	
	In the .gitconfig file, the editor must be specified as

	[core]
	editor = subl -w

	Without the "-w", it won't commit.

Simplify history (e.g. in prep for a PR, though the PR can also squash):
	- rebase branch to itself using a hash
	- soft/mixed reset and then commit changes in a way that tells a helpful story
	- if a file was track and is no longer tracked, git rm that file from branch-a before rebasing it on branch-b.
